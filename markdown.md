**Calculations and Reasoning:**

*   **Scrap Rate:** To fulfill a sales order of 96 units with a 5.0% scrap rate, `ceil(96 / (1 - 0.05)) = 102` units must be produced.
*   **Initial Stock:** The current stock level of Product A is 2 units.
*   **Production Capacity:** The factory's maximum daily production capacity is 100 units.
*   **Lead Time:** Production must occur one day before the product is sold.
*   **Weekend Restriction:** No production is allowed on Saturdays or Sundays. Therefore, for Monday sales, production must be completed by the preceding Friday.

The optimization strategy aims to ensure On-Time In-Full (OTIF) delivery for all sales orders while minimizing finished goods inventory by scheduling production as close to the sales date as possible.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **Starting Inventory:** 2 units of Product A.

2.  **Sales Orders due 2025-06-30 (2 orders for 96 units each, total 192 units):**
    *   Total production required to cover these orders (after scrap): 2 * 102 = 204 units.
    *   Net production needed from the factory (after utilizing initial stock): 204 - 2 (initial stock) = 202 units.
    *   Latest possible production date for these Monday sales orders is 2025-06-27 (Friday).
    *   **Production Schedule:**
        *   2025-06-26: Produce 100 units.
        *   2025-06-27: Produce 100 units.
    *   **Inventory before sales on 2025-06-30:** 2 (initial) + 100 (from 06-26) + 100 (from 06-27) = 202 units.
    *   **Inventory after sales on 2025-06-30:** 202 - 192 = 10 units remaining.

3.  **Sales Orders due 2025-07-07 (2 orders for 96 units each, total 192 units):**
    *   Total production required: 2 * 102 = 204 units.
    *   Net production needed from the factory (after utilizing current stock of 10 units): 204 - 10 = 194 units.
    *   Latest possible production date for these Monday sales orders is 2025-07-04 (Friday).
    *   **Production Schedule:**
        *   2025-07-03: Produce 94 units (to meet the remaining requirement efficiently).
        *   2025-07-04: Produce 100 units.
    *   **Inventory before sales on 2025-07-07:** 10 (previous remaining) + 94 (from 07-03) + 100 (from 07-04) = 204 units.
    *   **Inventory after sales on 2025-07-07:** 204 - 192 = 12 units remaining.

4.  **Sales Order due 2025-07-14 (1 order for 96 units):**
    *   Total production required: 1 * 102 = 102 units.
    *   Net production needed from the factory (after utilizing current stock of 12 units): 102 - 12 = 90 units.
    *   Latest possible production date for this Monday sales order is 2025-07-11 (Friday).
    *   **Production Schedule:**
        *   2025-07-11: Produce 90 units.
    *   **Inventory before sales on 2025-07-14:** 12 (previous remaining) + 90 (from 07-11) = 102 units.
    *   **Inventory after sales on 2025-07-14:** 102 - 96 = 6 units remaining.

This optimized plan ensures all sales orders are fulfilled on time, takes into account the scrap rate, adheres to factory capacity, and avoids production on weekends, while minimizing finished goods inventory. The initial production orders from the input data have been disregarded in favor of this optimized schedule, as per the ability to change production quantity and date.
